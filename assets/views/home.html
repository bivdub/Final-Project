        <h2 class="about">What is Sentiment Analysis?</h2>
        <p class="about">Humans are an information-gathering species. Many tools lend themselves to this task, but perhaps the oldest behavior for gathering information is finding out what other people think and feel. In our digital age, the growing availability and popularity of opinion based resources (think online reviews, blogs, twitter, thumbs up/down voting) creates new ways to seek and understand the tastes, opinions and feelings of others. The eruption of text based apps gives us new ways to computationally analyze the subjectivity, opinion, sentiments and feelings; effectively ‘mood mining’ our peers and social groups. </p>

        <h3 class="about">Project Details</h3>
        <p class="about">Our goal with Mood Mining was to create engaging visualization tools for subjective and somewhat abstract data sets. We used Twitter and Weather API’s and searched for “I feel” and “feeling” statements, filtered by region, and by current weather. After amassing our data, we passed all of our ‘feelings’ through an algorithm to evaluate the overall positive or negative score of each term. </p>

        <p class="about">For our Music visualization we varied our search terms slightly. We searched for “listening” and “listen” and further filtered the data with the top artists from the LastFm API, by metro region.  We then applied our sentiment algorithm to the statements from Twitter, related to artist, and evaluated the overall positive or negative response to each artist.</p>
